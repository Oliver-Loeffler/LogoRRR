# javafx-logboard

JavaFX logboard is a simple utility to display a logfile and visualise certain classes of events. 

For example, ERROR events are visualized as a red rectangle, TRACE events as grey rectangles, INFO events as GREEN ones etc. 

This project serves as a vehicle to test and learn about various aspects of JavaFX GraalVM compilation.
