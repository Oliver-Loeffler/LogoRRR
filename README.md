# LogoRRR

![Screenshot](screencast.gif)

LogoRRR is a simple utility to display a logfile and visualise certain classes of events. 

For example, ERROR events are visualized as red rectangles, TRACE events as grey rectangles, INFO events as green ones etc. 

## Motivation

This project serves as a vehicle to test and learn about various aspects of JavaFX GraalVM compilation. [This blog post](https://ladstatt.blogspot.com/2020/10/compile-scala-javafx-application-with.html) was written to accompany the initial public release of this github repository, describing challenges performing AOT with GraalVM and the surrounding tooling.

## Download 

You can give it a try by downloading a [prebuilt installer for LogoRRR](https://github.com/rladstaetter/LogoRRR/releases/tag/21.2.4) from the releases page. There are binaries for Windows and MacOs available.

### Installation 

#### Windows

As of Release 21.3.0, there exists an Installer for this application, which can be found on the releases page. 

**Please note**: Because LogoRRR is not digitally signed you are going to see warnings when trying to download, install or start the application. This will not change until it is digitally signed. However, for this project no such certificate exists yet.

#### MacOsX

For Mac Users, quite some motivation is needed at the moment to get the application to run.

You'll have to give the application rights to be executed which can be done in a terminal with the command

    chmod 755 app.logorrrr

Afterwards you have to specify in your preferences menu that you allow to start this application. Finally then you can start it via command line. 

## Features

- Drag and drop log files to application to visualize/view them
- Handle multiple log files in parallel
- Filter log files for entries interactively
- Basic search functionality
- Unix `tail -f` like functionality to watch ongoing events
- Windows Installer

# Development information 

The rest of this document describes how to build LogoRRR from source.

## Prerequisites

You have to download a recent GraalVM installation package (I've tested it with 21.0.0.r11) and a maven distribution (everything starting from 3.6.3 should work).

Currently this application can analyze log files which were generated by `java.util.logging`. The log output is dependent on your locale, you can override settings by providing `-Duser.language=en` as JVM parameter for your application.

## Usage

You can start LogoRRR via double click from the desktop. Add a log file simply via drag'n drop.

Alternatively, you can start LogoRRR via command line and provide the path to the log file as command line parameter (or multiple at once if you like).


## Building

Given you have followed the instructions for [maven-gluonfx-plugin](https://github.com/gluonhq/gluonfx-maven-plugin) you only have to provide the path to your GraalVM installation in the main pom.xml found at the root folder of the project.

### MacOs X

Following commands should get you a working environment. This is a fast way to install everything you'll need as far as I remember. 

    git clone https://github.com/rladstaetter/LogoRRR.git
    curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
    sdk install maven 3.8.1
    sdk install java 21.1.0.r11-grl

(https://sdkman.io is a package manager specifically tailored for java development, you can install various JVM based utilities / libraries and tools with it, manage different JVM versions as well - very handy!)

After this initial setup, you should be ready to build via maven. You have to adapt some paths in `pom.xml` - just search for `graalvm.home` and make sure it is pointing to the correct path.

Execute

     mvn clean package

in the project directory (where `pom.xml` is located).

After spending some time compiling all necessary modules a binary executable which can be run without a JVM should be 
available here:

    ./dist/dist-osx/binary-osx/target/gluonfx/x86_64-darwin/app.logorrr.dist.osx.binary


### Windows 

To setup your Windows development environment, you have to perform following steps:

- Visual Studio 2019 (Community Edition should suffice, tested with Visual Studio Professional)
- GraalVM in a recent version (at least [21.1.0](https://github.com/graalvm/graalvm-ce-builds/releases/tag/vm-21.1.0)), for the moment stick to JDK 11 based version
- put GraalVM in your Path
- As Administrator, execute 'gu install native-image' in a 'x64 Native Tools command prompt' - which will be available if you have Visual Studio installed.
- for normal compilation, you don't need administrator rights. 

After setting `graalvm.home` in the main pom.xml to your GraalVM Installation directory all you have to do to get to a binary is:

     mvn clean package

A binary is available here after some minutes:
    
    target\gluonfx\x86_64-windows\logorrr.exe

If you want to execute this exe on another computer, you have to make sure that the Visual Studio runtime environment is present there. If not, you can download [Visual Studio 2019 redistributables here](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe). (If you are lucky its already installed on your machine). If the application doesn't start - this is a possible reason for that.  

#### Additional Setup information for GRAALVM

You should set `GRAALVM_HOME` and `JAVA_HOME`, as well as your `PATH` system variable.

For my setup, those commands work
 
    set GRAALVM_HOME=C:\Program Files\Java\graalvm-ce-java11-21.1.0
    set JAVA_HOME=%GRAALVM_HOME%
    set PATH=%GRAALVM_HOME%\bin;%PATH%

'native-image' is an addon for GraalVM, you have to install it manually via `gu`. `gu` itself is an application which
manages `GRAALVM` dependencies. It can be called on command line if `%GRAALVM_HOME%\bin` is in your PATH.


## Running from IntelliJ

Running JavaFX applications in IntelliJ needs a some more work if you work with modularized Java. There are builds of Java which incorporate JavaFX (from Azul for example) where following steps are not necessary. However, if you use GraalVM or AdoptOpenJDK builds, you have to provide special VM Parameters in order to start a JavaFX application from your IDE. 

As such, you have to provide following parameters:

    --module-path <path to your javafx sdk lib directory> --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml

For me following settings work:

    --module-path /Users/lad/gh/javafx-sdk-16/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml

Note that you have to download this javafx-sdk separately and install it once on your computer, you can get it on [Gluon's Download Page for JavaFX](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/). 

A comprehensive tutorial how to get started with developing JavaFX can be found on [openjfx.io](https://openjfx.io). 

## Configuring GraalVM native-image 

`gluonfx-maven-plugin` helps to configure GraalVM compilation by providing a command which creates a configuration for 
`native-image` by analysing the runtime behavior of an application. Navigate to the `./dist/dist-win/binary-win/` or 
`./dist/dist-osx/binary-osx/` subdirectory and enter following
command:

    mvn gluonfx:runagent

It will start LogoRRR. Now you have to execute all possible click paths - in your code repository configuration files will appear in `src/main/resources/META-INF/native-image/`. Those files are different depending on which OS you execute the application. 

Currently, those files are generated / checked in under src/main/native-image/<os>/, and via a maven configuration they are placed in the right place needed for native-image. Like this the project can be build on multiple platforms via 

    mvn package 

Implicitly, maven package will call `gluonfx:build` and create a binary executable. (On Windows the binary will be packed via [UPX](https://upx.github.io) to reduce the file size considerably.)
