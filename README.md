# `LogoRRR`

While exploring the log files is an essential part of troubleshooting, sometimes you may not want to go so deep. In
fact, when you get an error, you may simply want to see what happened as fast as possible and in a clear way. `LogoRRR`
is a tool that does precisely that and provides you with a quick way to filter out critical events or other points of
interest.
